PMR Network Design for Shahr-e Bābak
This repository presents the design and simulation of a Private Mobile Radio (PMR) network using Radio Mobile software, covering an area of 100 km x 100 km centered around Shahr-e Bābak, Iran.

The goal of this project is to ensure robust digital voice and data coverage using a minimal yet strategically optimized repeater network.
